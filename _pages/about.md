I am a developer working at the intersection of machine learning and cybersecurity, with a focus on building secure and intelligent systems. I also explore computer graphics as a creative way to apply the math behind visual computing.

In my [projects](/projects), I aim to turn theoretical concepts into practical tools. Some of the things I’m working on include:

- **Federated Intrusion Detection System** – A privacy-preserving approach to collaborative threat detection.  
- **Log-Based Anomaly Detection Tool** – A command-line utility for scanning system logs and identifying suspicious activity.  
- **Guided Numerical Integration for Chaotic Systems** – Research with [Dr. Adam Runions](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=LvaJVncAAAAJ&hl=en) on using ML to optimize numerical integrators for physical simulations.

I’m always open to collaboration - please feel free to contact me using one of the channels below.
